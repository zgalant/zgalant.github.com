    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It's now been one day since I changed the price of my iPhone app,
<a href="http://app.net/donutdudespring">Donut Dude</a> to free, and I
already had 42 downloads!</p>

<p>That's 42 downloads in one day with no advertising for a game that's been
on the store for 2 years!</p>

<p>I made the game mainly to learn iPhone programming a couple years ago
and figured that I'd put it on the store for $1 just to see what
happened.</p>

<p>I probably made about $300 total on the app, but recently I haven't
had almost any downloads. I figured that I had saturated the market
of my younger cousins and my little brother's friends, so I finally
just gave up on making one dollar per month and just made it free.</p>

<p>It was totally worth it. Now, there are 42 more people in the world
playing my game, which is pretty cool, since I probably know none of them.</p>

<p>And it's only been one day! Maybe I actually made Angry Birds but never
let anyone discover it because of the one dollar pricetag haha.</p>
