<p>I recently graduated from Stanford with a degree in Computer Science, and I&#8217;m
currently starting a company called <a href="http://codehs.com">CodeHS</a>.</p>

<p>There are plenty of opportunities for me to work for awesome companies
(Emails with job offers actually annoy me now), but I chose to start
a company for a few main reasons, which I&#8217;ll outline here.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of
starting a company, you should think about your reasons as well because it
really affects how you go about running your company.</p>

<h3>1. Work On My Own Schedule</h3>

<p>This is big for me. I&#8217;m not a 9 to 5 (or 9 to 9) type. Sometimes, I want
to work until 3am or wake up at noon, and I can do that. As long as I&#8217;m
being productive, I can work whenever I want.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll especially enjoy this once Winter rolls around because I don&#8217;t
need to keep to a Monday-Friday schedule either.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a huge skier, and I spent the last four years skiing on weekends every
winter with the <a href="http://skiing.stanford.edu">Stanford Ski Team</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#8217;t just have to wait for the weekend. If it&#8217;s snowing on a Tuesday,
I&#8217;ll go skiing on Tuesday. I can avoid the lift lines that build up on
weekends and enjoy the mountain to myself during the week.</p>

<h3>2. Sense of Ownership</h3>

<p>Because I&#8217;m starting a company, not only do I actually own part of it in
terms of stock shares, I actually feel like it belongs to me.</p>

<p>When people have good things to say about CodeHS, it&#8217;s really meaningful
because I was heavily involved in making it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m proud of what we&#8217;ve made much more than had I been working on just a
small cog of a much larger software project.</p>

<p>Especially since I&#8217;m responsible for both high level and specific things,
it&#8217;s easy to show people what I&#8217;ve done and talk about it. There&#8217;s something
that I&#8217;ve done that any of my friends and family can understand and
appreciate at some level.</p>

<p>I also get to talk about what I&#8217;m working on. I&#8217;m gonna pick on my friend
who works at Facebook for a second
(if you&#8217;re reading this, yeah, you. sorry haha!).</p>

<p>She loves her job, but I went to have lunch with her one day this summer,
and she couldn&#8217;t tell me what she was working on. I feel like I put a lot
of effort into what I&#8217;m working on, and it&#8217;s fun to talk about with my
friends and family, and I get to do that.</p>

<h3>3. Variety</h3>

<p>I do really enjoy sitting down and programming for an entire day, but I don&#8217;t
want to do that every day. Because I&#8217;m starting my own company, I get to
work on so many other aspects of the company and really spend time doing a
lot of different things.</p>

<p>Some days I code, but some days I&#8217;m teaching. I get to talk to a lot of
people. I&#8217;m doing sales, pitching our idea to people, strategizing our
distribution model, and so much more.</p>

<p>This helps me stay out of a routine that could bore me or get old. There are
always new things that come up, and I get to change what I focus on all the
time.</p>
