  <p>It turns out I spend a lot of time in the car.
Over the past few weeks since I started listening to audiobooks,
I&#8217;ve completed quite a few.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a list of them with a brief thought.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061251321/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061251321&linkCode=as2&tag=zacgal-20"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0061251321&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=zacgal-20" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=zacgal-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0061251321" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<h3>Tribal Leadership</h3>

<p>Blog post <a href="http://zachgalant.com/blog/2013/03/30/tribal-leadership/">here</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062060244/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062060244&linkCode=as2&tag=zacgal-20"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0062060244&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=zacgal-20" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=zacgal-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0062060244" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<h3>The Innovator&#8217;s Dilemma</h3>

<p>Love the idea of the disruptive innovation.
Hate how the word disrupt has taken a life of its own that&#8217;s so far from this meaning.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307465357&linkCode=as2&tag=zacgal-20"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0307465357&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=zacgal-20" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=zacgal-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0307465357" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<h3>The 4-Hour Workweek</h3>

<p>Tim Ferriss is a bit ridiculous and pretty arrogant,
but I liked a lot of the tips. The parts I liked most were the ones
talking about outsourcing and working from home/anywhere &#8211; I&#8217;m in Tahoe writing this :)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0446698202/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0446698202&linkCode=as2&tag=zacgal-20"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0446698202&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=zacgal-20" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=zacgal-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0446698202" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<h3>The No Asshole Rule</h3>

<p>Pretty obvious stuff here. Don&#8217;t be an asshole, don&#8217;t hire any assholes,
but if you have one around, it can be a great bonding experience for the
rest of the people.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1439167346/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1439167346&linkCode=as2&tag=zacgal-20"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1439167346&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=zacgal-20" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=zacgal-20&l=as2&o=1&a=1439167346" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<h3>How to Win Friends and Influence People</h3>

<p>Lots of simple things, but you begin to notice them a lot.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0143118757/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0143118757&linkCode=as2&tag=zacgal-20"><img border="0" src="http://ws.assoc-amazon.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0143118757&Format=_SL110_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=zacgal-20" ></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=zacgal-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0143118757" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></p>

<h3>Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In</h3>

<p>Interesting thoughts on negotiation. It&#8217;s crazy how much of life is negotiable.</p>

  <p>The first audiobook I completed was
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061251321/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0061251321&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zacgal-20">Tribal Leadership</a>
by Dave Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright.</p>

<p>I chose this book because I heard Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos,
talk about how the Zappos culture is the most important attribute of the company.
He recommends all Zappos employees read the book, and they
often have discussions based on the book inside the company.</p>

<p>The book explains that all human organizations are made up of tribes,
which are groups of up to 150 people who share work. Many different types of organizations
can be considered tribes, ranging from companies to sports teams to school classrooms.</p>

<h2>The Five Stages:</h2>

<p>Tribes can be classified in one of five stages, which explains how
functional and successful the tribe is.</p>

<p><strong>Stage One</strong>: People in the tribe hate life.
They don&#8217;t like working with others, and they have no aspirations.</p>

<p><strong>Stage Two</strong>: People have goals but feel destined to fail.
They don&#8217;t believe they have the ability to improve their situation.</p>

<p><strong>Stage Three</strong>: People are highly motivated to improve their own life and move up the food chain.
They have a competitive edge and compete with others for success.
They act with their own best interest in mind.</p>

<p><strong>Stage Four</strong>: People are motivated by the success of the tribe as a whole. They act with the best interest of the group in mind, and they are supportive of the other members of their tribe. The tribe is focused on beating their competition as a group, and they are financially very successful.</p>

<p><strong>Stage Five</strong>: This is rare. The tribe is not focused on competition with other humans, but instead, with only improving the world and reaching a greater good. An example is Amgen, who is more focused on curing cancer than increasing their profits.</p>

<h2>Moving from one stage to the next</h2>

<p>Much of the book focuses on how to move from one stage from the next.
It describes how to recognize the stage your tribe is in and how to make
concrete improvements to bring your tribe to a higher stage.</p>

<p>One of the main rules was that you can only move up one stage at a time.</p>

<p>This was one that I found extremely interesting. It is essentially saying
that it&#8217;s impossible to jump directly to a stage 4 or stage 5 tribe, both
of which are considered to be the stages at which organizations are highly
functional and successful.</p>

<p>One thing that came to my mind was that it seems that some organizations
attempt to jump straight to Stage Five without first reaching Stage Four,
which is a problem.</p>

<p>That sort of behavior can be seen in many non-profits organizations.</p>

<p>Many people start or join non-profits with the goal of changing the world for the better.
Their entire focus is on improving some issue they see in the world. This sounds like
a person who belongs in a Stage Five organization, but there is just one issue&#8230;
They never got to Stage Four.</p>

<p>Non-profits will often try to skip over Stage Four, so they can focus on &#8220;saving the world.&#8221;
According to the book, this is not possible, and it&#8217;s clear that many unsuccessful non-profits
haven&#8217;t noticed.</p>

<p>By trying to skip Stage Four, they skip the stage where the organization teams up
and becomes financially successful, beating out their competition. Since they do
not have this success, they cannot thrive as a team and organization well enough to
raise money for their cause and create meaningful change.</p>

<h2>CodeHS as a For-Profit Company</h2>

<p>This point hits close to home, since many people ask me why my company, CodeHS,
is not a non-profit. People hear that our mission is to educate high schoolers
by teaching them to code online, so they assume that our goals are noble, and we
should move beyond caring about the financial success of our company, since we clearly
just care about learning outcomes and improving the world.</p>

<p>This, however, is just not feasible. If we changed our model to that of a non-profit,
we would become dependent on fundraising to continue our venture. We&#8217;d be significantly
less able to make money ourselves and become a successful Stage Four company.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s wonderful that people want to create educational resources that are freely available,
but that is not sustainable if you cannot make enough money to support your organization.</p>

<p>This leads to an even worse outcome, which is that the content just goes away or the organization
just stops improving or supporting it.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t want that to happen. By trying to make CodeHS a viable business first, we are
trying to be a successful Stage Four organization, so we can then, make the leap
to Stage Five and focus on improving the world.</p>

<p>We feel that starting a for-profit company is actually a better, safer path to
creating social good than starting a non-profit can be.</p>

  <p>I&#8217;ve decided I will start to listen to audio books. I really don&#8217;t know why I haven&#8217;t started doing this before because they really make perfect sense for me. I haven&#8217;t read books for fun in years, and that&#8217;s kind of a problem, so here&#8217;s why audio books are the solution.</p>

<h3>I&#8217;m Bad at Reading</h3>

<p>That sounds odd, but I don&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m not literate. What I really mean is that I am bad at sitting down, opening up a book, starting to read it, and not falling asleep. I&#8217;m so confident that I&#8217;ll be unable to read it while staying awake that I don&#8217;t even try to read books. Maybe it&#8217;s attention span, since I&#8217;m able to read articles, but something about books just puts me to sleep.</p>

<h3>I Spend a Lot of Time Driving and Traveling</h3>

<p>I hate driving. It&#8217;s necessary to get places, but it&#8217;s really boring for me, and I hate wasting the time. Listening to audiobooks in the car is a great solution to making long drives feel productive. Now, if I spend a lot of time driving, at least I&#8217;ll start to cruise through books. I also spend a lot of time on public transportation and in airports and on airplanes, which are also perfect times to just listen to books and not feel like I&#8217;ve lost the time.</p>

<h3>I can speed them up</h3>

<p>Just like lectures, I can speed up audio books and feel even more productive. 2x speed sounds normal to me, so why not feel twice as productive?</p>

  <p>I was interested in coding long before I knew how to actually code anything.
When I was in 4th grade, I started making my own
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000DMAI/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00000DMAI&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zacgal-20">StarCraft</a>
maps with custom
triggers and events. When I was in 7th grade, I learned to make my own video games
on the computer using a program called
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J0KP7O/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000J0KP7O&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=zacgal-20">Multimedia Fusion</a>.</p>

<p>Through high school, I created my own independent study computer class in all
12 trimesters over the four years, so I could learn what I wanted. I learned
a little bit of a lot of things, but I was never able to get anywhere far on
my own.</p>

<p>I learned a little bit of Maya for 3D Animation, the most basic Flash Actionscript,
how to use Dreamweaver (worthless), Photoshop, Illustrator, and got through about
1-2 chapters of a C++ book before getting stuck and stopping.</p>

<p>I used tools like the Unreal Engine and Hammer Editor to make 3D games and
messed around making little programs on my calculator during math class,
but I never really learned to code until I went to college.</p>

<p>This is why I&#8217;m so excited to be working on CodeHS. I had essentially been trying
to learn to code since I was in 4th grade, but I never really learned until my
freshman year of college.</p>

<h3>I&#8217;m making CodeHS for me 8 years ago.</h3>

<p>I get so frustrated sometimes that I didn&#8217;t have the resources to learn it myself,
and I&#8217;m so excited to give current high schoolers the opportunity they deserve to
learn what I tried to learn in high school.</p>

<p>I had access to books and had the desire to learn, but never someone to help me.
I had no idea where to start, and whatever I tried seemed too difficult and
confusing.</p>

<p>With CodeHS, I&#8217;m trying to fix all of the problems I had when I tried to learn.
It&#8217;s extremely easy to get started because you don&#8217;t have to worry about
downloading programs or IDEs and can just code in the browser. And most importantly,
students get access to real people who help them out when they get stuck.</p>

<p>These are all things I wish I had when I was in high school, and I love that
I can help out kids like me do what I wasn&#8217;t able to do.</p>

  <p>I recently graduated from Stanford with a degree in Computer Science, and I&#8217;m
currently starting a company called <a href="http://codehs.com">CodeHS</a>.</p>

<p>There are plenty of opportunities for me to work for awesome companies
(Emails with job offers actually annoy me now), but I chose to start
a company for a few main reasons, which I&#8217;ll outline here.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re thinking of
starting a company, you should think about your reasons as well because it
really affects how you go about running your company.</p>

<h3>1. Work On My Own Schedule</h3>

<p>This is big for me. I&#8217;m not a 9 to 5 (or 9 to 9) type. Sometimes, I want
to work until 3am or wake up at noon, and I can do that. As long as I&#8217;m
being productive, I can work whenever I want.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll especially enjoy this once Winter rolls around because I don&#8217;t
need to keep to a Monday-Friday schedule either.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a huge skier, and I spent the last four years skiing on weekends every
winter with the <a href="http://skiing.stanford.edu">Stanford Ski Team</a>.</p>

<p>Now, I don&#8217;t just have to wait for the weekend. If it&#8217;s snowing on a Tuesday,
I&#8217;ll go skiing on Tuesday. I can avoid the lift lines that build up on
weekends and enjoy the mountain to myself during the week.</p>

<h3>2. Sense of Ownership</h3>

<p>Because I&#8217;m starting a company, not only do I actually own part of it in
terms of stock shares, I actually feel like it belongs to me.</p>

<p>When people have good things to say about CodeHS, it&#8217;s really meaningful
because I was heavily involved in making it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m proud of what we&#8217;ve made much more than had I been working on just a
small cog of a much larger software project.</p>

<p>Especially since I&#8217;m responsible for both high level and specific things,
it&#8217;s easy to show people what I&#8217;ve done and talk about it. There&#8217;s something
that I&#8217;ve done that any of my friends and family can understand and
appreciate at some level.</p>

<p>I also get to talk about what I&#8217;m working on. I&#8217;m gonna pick on my friend
who works at Facebook for a second
(if you&#8217;re reading this, yeah, you. sorry haha!).</p>

<p>She loves her job, but I went to have lunch with her one day this summer,
and she couldn&#8217;t tell me what she was working on. I feel like I put a lot
of effort into what I&#8217;m working on, and it&#8217;s fun to talk about with my
friends and family, and I get to do that.</p>

<h3>3. Variety</h3>

<p>I do really enjoy sitting down and programming for an entire day, but I don&#8217;t
want to do that every day. Because I&#8217;m starting my own company, I get to
work on so many other aspects of the company and really spend time doing a
lot of different things.</p>

<p>Some days I code, but some days I&#8217;m teaching. I get to talk to a lot of
people. I&#8217;m doing sales, pitching our idea to people, strategizing our
distribution model, and so much more.</p>

<p>This helps me stay out of a routine that could bore me or get old. There are
always new things that come up, and I get to change what I focus on all the
time.</p>

  <p>It&#8217;s now been one day since I changed the price of my iPhone app,
<a href="http://app.net/donutdudespring">Donut Dude</a> to free, and I
already had 42 downloads!</p>

<p>That&#8217;s 42 downloads in one day with no advertising for a game that&#8217;s been
on the store for 2 years!</p>

<p>I made the game mainly to learn iPhone programming a couple years ago
and figured that I&#8217;d put it on the store for $1 just to see what
happened.</p>

<p>I probably made about $300 total on the app, but recently I haven&#8217;t
had almost any downloads. I figured that I had saturated the market
of my younger cousins and my little brother&#8217;s friends, so I finally
just gave up on making one dollar per month and just made it free.</p>

<p>It was totally worth it. Now, there are 42 more people in the world
playing my game, which is pretty cool, since I probably know none of them.</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s only been one day! Maybe I actually made Angry Birds but never
let anyone discover it because of the one dollar pricetag haha.</p>

  <p>Not all startup incubators are equal, but at the same time, there is no one best one.
There are <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/tomiogeron/2012/04/30/top-tech-incubators-as-ranked-by-forbes-y-combinator-tops-with-7-billion-in-value/">lists</a>
that try to rank them, but
it all really depends on your needs and goals and your companies&#8217; needs and goals.
Here I&#8217;ll outline the 4 &#8220;incubators&#8221; I&#8217;ve participated in and how they all have different goals.
(Note: I&#8217;m using the word incubator. Some are not exactly incubators but accelerators. Whatever.)</p>

<p>tldr:<br/>
<strong>Lightspeed:</strong> Summer program for students to learn<br/>
<strong>Launchpad:</strong> Apply design thinking to your startup and push your limits<br/>
<strong>StartX:</strong> Create a community<br/>
<strong>Imagine K12:</strong> Connect you to the education world</p>

<h3>Lightspeed Summer Fellowship</h3>

<h4>The Goal</h4>

<p>The Lightspeed program has a very specific goal, and believe it or not, that goal is not
to make money for Lightspeed. The goal is for the participants to <em>learn what entrepreneurship
is all about</em>.</p>

<p>How do they do this? The program is specifically limited to students. The idea is that
students have options for summer jobs. They can get well paying internships at top
tech companies or startups that can be difficult to turn down. This leaves little room
for pursuing a startup full time for the summer because there is pressure to make money.</p>

<p>Lightspeed removes this pressure by giving $10,000 to each founder (up to 4) for the summer,
so you can work on your idea and not worry about turning down another offer. In addition,
they give $5000 to the company to use however they choose, and they take no equity.</p>

<h4>My Experience</h4>

<p>I did the Lightspeed program the summer after my Junior year. I worked on a website
called <a href="/projects">Raunk</a> with four of my best friends. We lived in Menlo Park and got incredible
(normally insnanely expensive) office space on Sand Hill Road for free. We routinely
spent 12+ hours in the office and developed a full fledged website.</p>

<p>We ended up getting
3000 signed up users and over 60,000 ratings, but the site wasn&#8217;t successful. We all
went back to school in the fall, though we did some really cool machine learning and
data visualization projects using ratings data we collected.</p>

<p>Overall, I learned a lot about starting a company and building a website, and I
didn&#8217;t sacrifice a summer of pay to do so. For me at that time, this program was
exactly what I needed.</p>

<h3>Launchpad</h3>

<p>This isn&#8217;t exactly an incubator. It&#8217;s a 10 week class at the d.school at Stanford
taught by Michael Dearing and Perry Klebahn. The goal is to push your boundaries
in every way possible.</p>

<p>They accepted 12 companies to the class and told us on the first day that we wouldn&#8217;t
all be there by the end. Most of the companies were at the very beginning stage, so
the first assignment was very tough. We had to have a functional prototype in one
week. Keep in mind, we&#8217;re all taking other classes at the same time. The next assignment
was to test our prototype with real users by just two days later.</p>

<p>The class is called Launchpad, so it was no surprise that we were forced to launch
our companies at a trade show after only 4 weeks. This requird us to narrow our product
to its essential features and prioritize. It took the term minimum viable product to
an extreme.</p>

<p>The rest of the class similarly pushed us in many other ways. We refined our pitches
every class, but we were never told who would be at class. Sometimes it was just the
course staff, and sometimes there were angel investors. One time, we were told to
prepare a 3 minute pitch to a news anchor only to arrive at class and find out we only
had 30 seconds.</p>

<p>These are things that happen in the real world, and the class prepared us to be surprised
and stay ready for anything.</p>

<p>Other days, we were making cold sales calls to small businesses in Alaska or selling lemonade.
One day, they brought a Nascar pit crew to class, and we had a competition to see which team
could change tires the fastest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we were still plugging away on our website. The course staff took no excuses,
expected the best, and challenged all of our assumptions about everything from
target market to business model to pricing scheme to hiring. We were pushed beyond our
limits and learned a lot from it.</p>

<h3>StartX</h3>

<p>StartX&#8217;s goals are very different from the previous two programs. Their primary goal is
to create a community of founders who trust each other and can learn from each other.</p>

<p>The StartX staff is the most hands on of any of the other programs I&#8217;ve done, and it&#8217;s
also the biggest program. There were 25 companies my session, and we all worked in
the StartX office.</p>

<p>The key element to StartX is the office space provided. They offer fundraising help,
access to mentors, a living stipend for founders, numerous educational speakers, and great
deals on services from Microsoft, Github, Rackspace, etc. But, the key to the program
is that all of the companies are working together. They go through the highs and lows
together. People are always around and willing to give feedback or just chat for a bit.</p>

<p>While there&#8217;s a lot to be said about the &#8220;hacker house&#8221; as shown in the Social Network movie,
the shared workspace is huge for building the sort of community StartX wants its founders to have.</p>

<h3>Imagine K12</h3>

<p>Since <a href="http://codehs.com">CodeHS</a> is an ed tech company, Imagine K12 makes a ton of sense for us.
Not only are the partners knowledgeable about education, they have incredible
connections to very influential people in the education space. We&#8217;ve had speakers
from Knewton, Teach For America, New Schools Venture Fund, The Innosight Institute,
and many more education specific companies.</p>

<p>The best part of Imagine K12 is that every company is in the same space, and none
of the companies are directly competing with each other (yet). That makes the contacts
in other companies 10x more valuable because we can all share tips and contacts. We are
all trying to talk to schools, and we can help each other do so.</p>

<p>The incubator created a group of companies that are all trying to use technology
to improve education. This common goal fosters a great community of people who all
believe in the missions of their peers.</p>

<p>I think that Imagine K12 is starting a trend of vertical specific incubators. They
make sense for many verticals, so why stop at education?</p>
