I spent all of last week working in Tahoe, and it was awesome.

One of the best parts about working on a startup is the freedom it 
grants you, particularly the ability to work from anywhere and 
not have to report to anybody.

It doesn't matter where I am working or when. What matters is just 
that I get my work done.

####Here was a typical schedule for me:

Wake up at 8 something.  
Catch up on grading and email for an hour or so.  
Do a bit of work for an hour.  
Eat some food.  
11:30 - Drive to the mountain.  
Ski from Noon to 2pm or so.  
Do some work at the mountain until 5 or so.  
Grab some food / head back to the cabin.  
Work from 6:30 or so until 11.  
Go to sleep at 11 something.

That's about 8-9 hours of work each day, a standard amount of work. 
I just happened to ski for a couple of hours in between and spend 
5-6 hours outside.

It was relaxing, productive, and fun. I finished the work I needed to 
and enjoyed myself.

The mountains are so quiet. At my apartment, I can hear cars driving by, 
people making noise, and everything that happens outside. 

Alone in a cabin in the mountains, I was able to focus on my work 
and sleep really well. I wasn't woken up by early morning street cleaning 
or late night motorcycles zooming by my window.

My only regret was that I hadn't done this earlier in the year when there 
was more snow.
