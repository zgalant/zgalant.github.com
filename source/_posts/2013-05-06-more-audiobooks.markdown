Spent a little less time in the car this month. Also started a couple books that I didn't really like.

Here's what I've been reading lately.

###The Black Swan
Very interesting points about how people get up in arms about certain things that are actually very unlikely. 
It's especially interesting having read this a little before the Boston Marathon bombings. 
This [article](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/apr/21/boston-marathon-bombs-us-gun-law) about gun deaths is pretty relevant.

###Quiet: The Power of Introverts ina  World That Can't Stop Talking
I didn't finish the book because I didn't like it very much. 
I see the intended point the author makes that introverts can have great ideas but can easily be ignored, 
but the book did not do a good job of explaining it. Instead, the author focused on examples of how extroverts 
are often wrong and that if they had just listened to the introvert, they would have been better off. 

While this can be the case, the evidence was not scientific, as she ignores the fact that an introvert can just 
as easily be wrong about something as they are right about it. 

One other thing I disagreed with was that the author almost sarcastically talks about how extroverts who make 
quick decisions are wrong to do so, while introverts who think longer and consider more information are always 
making better decisions.

It seems logical that the longer you take considering options, the better your decision will be. However, 
practically, this doesn't always make sense. Often (pretty much always), you have incomplete information 
about a situation, so waiting longer on a decision is actually just a waste of time, and the only way 
to make the best decision is to make a quick decision and react and adjust from there.

###The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: Powerful Lessons in Personal Change
Couldn't get into this one. The author spent what seemed like a really long time discussing the different perspectives one can have and 
how that affects how you view a situation. It all just seemed really obvious and too long for me, so I stopped reading.

###A Short History of Nearly Everything
Reading this one right now. Really enjoying it so far. It's a great way to refresh all the science and 
history of science I've learned for my entire life in a very well explained, understandable way.
