###Raunk
#####Rate anything. See Best-Of Lists.
In summer 2011, my friends and I participated in the Lightspeed Summer Fellowship and made Raunk. 
On Raunk, you can rate any item from 0 - 10. Every item has tags and every user has tags. 
Best-of lists are generated based on filtering by tags, so you can see lists called: 
Best Items with [item_tags] according to people with [person_tags]

###Donut Dude Spring
#####Simple, fun iPhone game.
