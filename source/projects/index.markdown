##Raunk
In summer 2011, my friends and I participated in the Lightspeed Summer Fellowship and made Raunk. 
On Raunk, you can rate any item from 0 - 10. 

Every item has tags and every user has tags. 
Best-of lists are generated based on filtering by tags, so you can see lists called: 
Best Items with [item_tags] according to people with [person_tags]

##Donut Dude Spring
Donut Dude is trapped in a world of springs, and he can only get out by eating all the donuts. Guide Donut Dude as he tries to get through all the levels as fast as possible. But watch out for the spikes! New levels will be automatically downloaded from the internet for unlimited fun.
Available on the iTunes App Store [here](http://app.net/donutdudespring).

##Computer Vision Object Detection
My group in CS 221 made a computer vision project using OpenCV libraries to create object classifiers for mugs, staplers, scissors, clocks, and keyboards in videos. (Apparently mugs look like scissors, btw).

We used a feature dictionary and boosted decision trees using AdaBoost to detect objects, then used multiple post-processing algorithms to optimize placement including optical flow, non-maximum suppression and averaging, and hough transform for circles.

I worked with Jeremy Keeshin and Eric Conner.

##Facebook Status Gender Classification
We used machine learning techniques including Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy Classification, and the Perceptron to train a program to learn what types of statuses are written by males and females. The project’s site has a demo application for you to try out. It was done for CS 224N at Stanford.

Check out the [project site](http://www.thekeesh.com/cs224n/) and read our paper.

I worked with Jeremy Keeshin and David Kravitz.

##Random Tweeter
In Summer 2009, I worked on a [project](http://stanford.edu/~zgalant/RandomTweeter/) to create a bot that produces random tweets using data from Twitter.

It takes information about trending topics and what people are saying on Twitter and creates a random tweet based on that information using a Generative Markov Model. Basically, it reads a lot of recent tweets and produces its own tweet from what it has learned.

I worked with David Kravitz, Joe Kelley, and Jacob Jaffe.

##Bump Classification
In early 2010, I worked with Jeremy Keeshin and Eric Conner on a project for Bump Technologies, creating a machine learning algorithm to improve the accuracy of classifying bumps between users when using their app.

##Terrible Life Decisions
I made a silly website a long time ago called [Terrible Life Decisions](http://terriblelifedecisions.appspot.com/), 
so I could learn to use Google App Engine.

It’s a place where people can share funny stories about stupid things they have done.
