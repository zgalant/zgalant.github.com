Hey, I'm Zach. Welcome to my site. I'm a Stanford grad working in San Francisco on [CodeHS](http://codehs.com). I'm obsessed with sports stats and am a diehard Dallas Mavericks fan. I wrote comedy for the [Stanford Flipside](http://stanfordflipside.com), and I probably wish I were skiing right now.
